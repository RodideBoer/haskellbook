# haskellbook

In this repository I include all answers, solutions and other snippets I come up with when going through the book [Haskell programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/).

All exercises are made while working through the book and without any prior understanding of Haskell. So please don't laugh...

If you find anything interesting, please let me know.
