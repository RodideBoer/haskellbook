Here are things about Haskell and related concepts that I think of and want to remember

### Typeclasses, Types and Instances
* A Typeclass is an abstraction over a set of Types
* A Type describes the data a program works with and has Instances of Typeclasses
* An Instance is the implementation of a Typeclass for a specific Type

They are somewhat comparable to Object Oriented concepts:
* A Typeclass is like an Interface (abstraction)
* A Type is like a Class
* An Instance is like the implementation of an Interface in a specific Class
